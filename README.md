 Note : This project is the one I learned when I was completing the online course on udemy i.e "Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks

 Deep Learning :
 --------------
  Deep learning is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages,   and making decisions. Deep learning AI is able to learn without human supervision, drawing from data that is both unstructured and unlabeled.
  
Artificial neural network :
--------------------------
  An artificial neural network (ANN) is the piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. It is the         foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards.
  
Solving Business Problem using ANN (Churn Modelling) :
-----------------------------------------------------
  "Churn Modelling" is dataset of a bank customers. Our aim is to stop customers leaving the bank. For that we are designing the "Deep Learning" model using ANN so we 
   can detect the possible customers who can leave the bank at perticular moment. Before they leave we will say goodbye to them. 

Example Problem :
----------------
  Use our ANN model to predict if the customer with the following informations will leave the bank: 

  Geography: France
  Credit Score: 600
  Gender: Male
  Age: 40 years old
  Tenure: 3 years
  Balance: \$ 60000
  Number of Products: 2
  Does this customer have a credit card ? Yes
  Is this customer an Active Member: Yes
  Estimated Salary: \$ 50000
  
Thank You !
